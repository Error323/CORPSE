<h1>Introduction</h1>
Avoiding collisions between groups of friendly units whose paths cross one
another, mixing units of various sizes and masses within groups, maintaining
group coherency as the units in them move to their individual destinations:
these are just some of the long-standing problematic areas in <i>Real-Time
Strategy</i> (RTS) games that surround the tasks of pathfinding and -following.
Many different approaches to these problems have been attempted, such as
emergent flocking behavior, social force rules, constrained particle-system
interactions, and others. One of the most recent models, introduced by
<i>Treuille et al., 2006</i>, is based on continuum dynamics. This website
will serve as a project report of our implementation of their <i>Continuum
Crowds</i> (CC) algorithm within our own (bare bones) RTS game engine.

<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
A thorough understanding of the real-time global crowd model presented in the
CC paper. Since this model is based on continuum dynamics, becoming familiar
with the <i>Fast Marching Method</i> (FMM) for solving constrained differential
equations will also be required. The overall goal is to gain experience with
state-of-the-art algorithms to perform pathfinding for large groups of agents
in full 3D, by implementing the model within a real-time strategy game engine.
The work will also serve as a stepping stone to a possible MSc. thesis.

<h2>Contents</h2>
The project will start by examining the literature, in particular on fluid
simulation methods and numerical integration. A 3D engine framework will be
programmed in which the CC algorithm can be integrated and evaluated under
crowd conditions typical of modern RTS games.

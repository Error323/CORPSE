<h1>Results</h1>
The following videos show the results of our implementation of the CC algorithm
within an RTS environment.
<h2>Scalar discomfort field</h2>
In the video below you can see an early implementation with a scalar discomfort
field. As the groups start moving, they immediately form a "line". This is
caused because the individual units in the groups try to avoid eachothers
discomfort zones which are scalar values at this point.

<h2>Vector discomfort field</h2>
In this video we can see the top left facing bottom right. The "weaving lanes"
formed here have a higher density this time, the discomfort field is vector
based and no discomfort is "felt" when approaching from the right direction.
That is, when approaching group-direction vector from an accute angle. Ensuring
more coherency between the units of a group.

<h2>Weaving Lanes</h2>
The units in this video from both groups form nice "weaving lanes" in order to
avoid each other.

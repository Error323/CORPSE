<h1>Conclusions</h1>
After implementing the algorithm near-verbatim as described in the paper
<i>(Treuille et al., 2006)</i> we found that we could not reproduce several of
the "flow" effects such as lane formation for two groups moving in opposite
directions.  Furthermore, each individual group tended to spread out far too
much from self-obstruction.
<br></br>
We discussed whether this was due to implementation errors or fundamental flaws
in the CC method. Looking at the <a
href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/crowd-flows/movs/continuum-crowds-divx.avi">demo
video</a> for clues etc. At this point we also mailed Treuille and replaced the
"weird" ABCD density conversion step with our own.
<br></br>
We eventually concluded that the scalar discomfort field was responsible
(because the projection of [predictive] discomfort values caused units "further
back" in a group to avoid those in front) and came up with the idea to convert
this to a vector field instead, which we later subdivided into mobile and
static components for even more fine-grained control.
<br></br>
Still we were largely unable to create single-file interleaving lanes as seen
in some CC videos, since dense multi-row groups of units will project
high-discomfort elongated "blob" zones (unless the grid is given extremely
large resolution) that typically force a number of wider "tracks" to form.
Furthermore, this change actually makes it harder for swirling vortices to
appear (one group moving SE and another moving SW generate an average
discomfort vector pointing S in the grid cells where their predictions overlap,
so both groups think the discomfort ahead is misaligned 45 degrees which has
only minor influence on their C's) without using an extreme amount of
prediction.
<br></br>
Our overall conclusion for applying CC in RTS games is that although it is
possible as we have shown, it requires a lot of tweaking and experimenting with
the parameters. For this project, unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to
make it work properly beyond a standard implementation as suggested in the
paper. However, we feel that our work provides a good basis/testbed to further
develop a robust pathfinding system for large groups within an RTS environment.

<h1>Approach</h1>
This section explains some (unmentioned) details of the algorithm that are
extracted from the paper by <i>Treuille et al., 2006</i>. Furthermore we will
explain key areas where we apply alternatives to certain parts of the suggested
algorithm. We highly recommend reading the paper itself, listed in the <a
href="/corpse/references">references</a>, before proceeding this section. For
the full details of our work we refer the reader to our <a
href="http://github.com/Error323/CORPSE">sourcecode</a>.
<br></br>
The first step toward implementing the full CC algorithm is to be able to
compute the potential field for a group.  This requires that the group's cost
field be known, which is formed by a simple linear combination of its speed-
and discomfort field. Next, the gradient of the group's potential field is
multiplied with the speed field to construct the velocity field, which finally
can be interpolated to update the individual positions of group members.

<h2>UpdateGroupPotentialField</h2>
This is the main function of the algorithm. It assumes the cost field has been
computed, and that the goal cells (the set of cells that units in a group want
to travel to) are given. From this information the new potential field is
calculated. As described above, this potential field (or rather its gradient)
is then used in a second step to move each unit along the shortest path of
least resistance to one of the goal cells. In pseudo-code, this looks as
follows:

<div class="Pseudocode">UpdateGroupPotentialField(IN goalCells, IN costField, OUT potField):
   CANDIDATES = PriorityQueue ## sorted by cell-potential, asc order
   KNOWN      = goalCells
   UNKNOWN    = allCells - goalCells

   foreach cell in KNOWN:
      potField[cell] = 0

   foreach cell in UNKNOWN:
      potField[cell] = +inf

   foreach cell in KNOWN:
      UpdateCandidates(cell)

   while (not Empty(CANDIDATES)):
      cell = Pop(CANDIDATES)
      Add(KNOWN, cell)
      UpdateCandidates(cell)
</div>

<h2>UpdateCandidates</h2>
This function examines possible candidate cells for the goal cells. Starting
with the neighbours of the goal cell as possible candidates, the algorithm
propagates outwards until all cells in the grid have a defined potential value.

<div class="Pseudocode">UpdateCandidates(IN cell):
   NEIGHBOURS = Neighbours(cell)
   foreach neighbour in NEIGHBOURS-KNOWN-CANDIDATES:
      costWest =
           potField[neighbour + WEST ] +
           costField[neighbour, neighbour + WEST ]
      costEast =
           potField[neighbour + EAST ] +
           costField[neighbour, neighbour + EAST ]
      costNorth =
           potField[neighbour + NORTH] +
           costField[neighbour, neighbour + NORTH]
      costSouth =
           potField[neighbour + SOUTH] +
           costField[neighbour, neighbour + SOUTH]

      ## potential is undefined along x-axis
      if (costWest is +inf and costEast is +inf):
         minPotCellVer = ArgMin_{cell}(costNorth, costSouth)
         potField[neighbour] = Potential1D(minPotCellVer)
         potFieldDelta{neighbour, minPotCellVer} =
            potField[neighbour] - potField[minPotCellVer]

      ## potential is undefined along y-axis
      elif (costNorth is +inf and costSouth is +inf):
         minPotCellHor = ArgMin_{cell}(costEast, costWest)
         potField[neighbour] = Potential1D(minPotCellHor)
         potFieldDelta{neighbour, minPotCellHor} =
            potField[neighbour] - potField[minPotCellHor]

      ## potential defined along both axes
      else:
         minPotCellHor = ArgMin_{cell}(costEast, costWest)
         minPotCellVer = ArgMin_{cell}(costNorth, costSouth)

         potField[neighbour] =
            Potential2D(neighbour, minPotCellHor, minPotCellVer)
         potFieldDelta{neighbour, minPotCellHor} =
            potField[neighbour] - potField[minPotCellHor]
         potFieldDelta{neighbour, minPotCellVer} =
            potField[neighbour] - potField[minPotCellVer]

      Push(CANDIDATES, neighbour)
</div>

<h2>Potential1D</h2>
Computes the potential of a cell for one dimension only as the other dimension
is undefined and can be neglected according to section 4.3 of the paper.

<div class="Pseudocode">Potential1D(IN curCell, IN neighbourCell):
   pot  = potField[neighbourCell]
   cost = costField[curCell, neighbourCell]

   solution1 = pot + cost
   solution2 = pot - cost
   return Max(solution1, solution2)
</div>

<h2>Potential2D</h2>
Computes the potential of a cell for both the X and Y dimension. This is based
on solving a quadratic equation Q for the unknown variable PHI_M (the new
potential value  for cell M), where Q defines a certain finite-difference
approximation to the underlying eikonal partial differential equation.

<div class="Pseudocode">Potential2D(IN curCell, IN horCell, IN verCell):
   potX  = potField[horCell]
   potY  = potField[verCell]
   costX = costField[curCell, horCell]
   costY = costField[curCell, verCell]

   a = (costX^2*potY + costY^2*costX) / (costX^2+costY^2)
   b = sqrt(costX^2 + costY^2)
   c = (costX * costY) / b

   phi_m_1 = a + c
   phi_m_2 = a - c
   return Max(phi_m_1, phi_m_2)
</div>

<h2>Density conversion</h2>
The density computation is used to compute a proper speedfield of the grid.
Each invidual unit projects a density around itself, making sure speed
decreases for other units approaching. The paper suggests a density conversion
scheme that is somewhat unconventional see section 4.1 for the "ABCD" scheme.
<br></br>
For our density conversion we applied a 2D gaussian density conversion around
each individual unit. As with this scheme individual units can have greater
dimensions then a single gridcell.

<h2>Discomfort field</h2>
The main purpose of the discomfort field is to handle geographic preferences.
A second usage of the discomfort field is to project a small amount in front of
each single unit in order to clear a path for this unit. The paper suggests a
discomfort scalar per cell. During our tests we discovered that this raised
problems when multiple rows of units are moving "in file" as they try to avoid
eachother's discomfort, creating lines of units instead of coherent groups. As
such, we decided to implement discomfort as a vector field.
<br></br>
With the discomfort now represented as a vector field (one vector per grid
cell) we could let the algorithm take directional information into account and
calculate a more accurate value for the true discomfort level influencing each
group's cost field (C) every frame, so that units all heading the same way
would minimally self-obstruct and maintain better coherence.
